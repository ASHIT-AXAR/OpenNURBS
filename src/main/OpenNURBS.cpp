/*
*    OpenNURBS Demo File
*
*    Shows how to:
*      - instantiate NURBS objects as object primitives
*      - extrude / filet / offset / deform / combine NURBS objects
*      - NURB curve / surface shortest distance (collision) calculation
*      - load and save as .nrb_geom geometry model files
*      - load, export meshes
*      - advanced mesh operations
*         - 3D space-filling meshes
*         - boundary layering based on offset surfaces
*         - binary mesh format
*         - distributed mesh formats
